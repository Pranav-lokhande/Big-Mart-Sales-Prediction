## Sales Prediction for Big Mart Outlets

The data scientists at BigMart have collected 2013 sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities. Certain attributes of each product and store have been defined, and the aim is to build a predictive model to forecast the sales of each product at a particular outlet.

By leveraging this model, BigMart aims to understand the key product and outlet attributes that contribute to increased sales.

## Data Considerations
Please note that the dataset may contain missing values due to technical glitches in data reporting. It is essential to handle these missing values appropriately during preprocessing.

## Data Dictionary
- **Train Dataset:** 8,523 observations (includes both input and output variables)
- **Test Dataset:** 5,681 observations (requires sales predictions)

The objective is to train a machine learning model using the train dataset and predict sales for the test dataset accurately.

## Project Workflow
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Understanding data distribution, handling missing values, and feature engineering.
2. **Feature Engineering** – Transforming categorical data, imputing missing values, and deriving new features.
3. **Model Building** – Experimenting with multiple regression models, including Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest, and AdaBoost.
4. **Evaluation** – Using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score to measure model performance.
5. **Prediction & Submission** – Generating predictions for test data and exporting the final results.

## Technologies Used
- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn)
- Machine Learning (Regression models, Ensemble methods)

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the EDA and preprocessing scripts.
4. Train and evaluate models.
5. Generate predictions for the test dataset.
